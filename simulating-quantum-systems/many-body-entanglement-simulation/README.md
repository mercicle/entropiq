The Quantum Zeno Effect, also known as the Turing paradox, is a feature of quantum-mechanical systems allowing a particle’s time evolution to be arrested by measuring it frequently enough with respect to some chosen measurement setting. Simply put, it is a phenomenon in quantum physics where observing a particle prevents it from decaying as it would in the absence of observation.
