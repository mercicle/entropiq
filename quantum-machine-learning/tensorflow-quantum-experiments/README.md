The [quantum_data.ipynb](https://www.tensorflow.org/quantum/tutorials/quantum_data) is an excellent example of a candid comparison because quantum and classical machine learning.

> the authors seek to understand how and when classical machine learning models can learn as well as (or better than) quantum models. The work also showcases an empirical performance separation between classical and quantum machine learning model via a carefully crafted dataset.
